    <h1>Privacy<span>First</span></h1>
    <section id="about">
      <p id="byline">Privacy<b>First</b> is a data privacy and security initiative for web developers and administrators.</p>
      <p>How many horror stories can we think of from just the past few years involving invasive tracking practices, massive data breaches the size of entire countries, and lawsuits that threaten the state of things like device encryption and personal data control, just to name a few?</p>
      <p>In this new, evolved World Wide Web, where almost any website or service has the ability to recieve and retain any information from users that they want, as well as the ability to track them from site to site without their knowledge, it is time for us &mdash; the web developers and administrators of the world &mdash; to start placing the user's privacy and security first, before anything else.</p>
      <p>When the topic of the prioritization of data privacy and security comes up, many times it devolves into diatribes and rants about "profitibility" and "feasibility," among other things. What if we could instill change for data security and privacy while also retaining profit margins and doing it with ease? A lot of the unease about having to move a company or service towards a more privacy-positive direction comes from not knowing alternatives to the services and behaviors that are causing security concerns in the first place. That's what the Privacy<b>First</b> initiative is for.</p>
      <p>Below, you'll find a non-comprehensive list of various commonly-used services that don't respect user privacy or have shady/unknown security practices, along with better alternatives.</p>
