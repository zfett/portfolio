      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>This document defines the specifications of the Animated Frame-mutation Image Format, otherwise known by its abbreviation “AFIF” or file extension “<span>.aff</span>,” including the image format's structure, features, methodologies, implementations, and unique capabilities to other comparative formats.</p>
      <p>This format differs from other animated image formats principally in the way that it stores the animated frame data. Instead of storing every single displayed frame, regardless of the perceived visual differences between each frame, AFIF stores a “base frame” as the 0th indexed frame and all subsequent pixel changes compared to prior frame data are stored sequentially. This is done to try to reduce the overall filesize and can enable web administrators and platforms to allow higher resolution and more fluid animated images by using this format.</p>

      <h2>1 Format Overview</h2>
      <p>A standard AFIF image consists of four main blocks of data: the image header, color table, frame data, and footer. The image header starts with the following hexadecimal values, correlating to the image's “magic byte” sequence: <span>0x41 0x46 0x49 0x46</span>. This sequence is then terminated with a null byte (<span>0x00</span>). Altogether, the file header should strictly be five bytes or forty bits in length, with the first four bytes or thirty-two bits representing the letters “AFIF” in ASCII form. The full header should appear as such in the file's raw, binary representation: <span>01000001 01000110 01001001 01000110 00000000</span>.</p>
