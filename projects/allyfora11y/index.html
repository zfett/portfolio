        <h2>About The Book</h2>
        <p>"An Ally for A11Y" is a book that encompasses an interest in web design that I've had for a while: web accessibility. I feel that in the grand scheme of modern web design, accessibility for those with disabilities that prevent them from using the web as easily as able-bodied people do has been overlooked for far too long. In "An Ally for A11Y," I break down what web accessibility truly means in the full scope of the topic and the various misconceptions that surround it.</p>

        <h2>About The Author</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Zachary Fetters and I am a web designer and developer with around eight years (at the time of writing the book) of experience and knowledge on the matter. For a few of my initial years in web development, accessibility was something that I, personally, never thought about in detail, and was certainly something that I never incorporated in any of my projects. While I cannot go back in time to right this wrong, I do understand the mindset that comes from not knowing virtually anything about web accessibility and how to implement it, which is something that I hope to address with this book.</p>

        <h2>Samples</h2>
        <blockquote><span>Perplexingly, also seen is the initial reaction to the recommendation of accessibility changes being annoyance or even anger. The first step towards creating an accessible, well, anything is to get rid of that attitude. Coming to terms with the fact that disabled people don’t all share the same type of stereotypically-perceived forms of disability will go a long way to creating a more robust accessible experience. Accessibility shouldn’t be a “political” issue, it should be a right for those who need it to use the same services that many of us get to use without hinderance every day. Alas, we don’t live in a perfect world. Where progress lacks, we must pick up the torch and light the way. It rests on the shoulders of the developers and designers of the world to make the Web a more friendly place for disabled people.</span> &mdash; Chapter 2: "More Than Code," page 2, paragraph 2.</blockquote>

        <h2>Thanks & Special Mentions</h2>
        <p>First, I'd love to give a very special thanks to my close and incredibly wise friend, Jesse Day. Without his extensive knowledge of the English language and frightening attention to detail, this book would be in worse shape.</p>
