			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<div class="text-container">
				<p>My name is<b> Zachary Fetters </b>and I am a freelance web and graphic designer. I've been designing since 2011 and I have started freelancing in September of 2020 in the hopes to build upon my client repertoire and gain professional experience in designing. My design focus is built upon strong, flashy colors and minimal presentation that isn't afraid to play with palettes and shapes.</p>
